// Accomplish the following:
// Loop through all numbers from 1 to 100.
for (let x = 1; x <= 100; i++) {
// If a number is divisible by 3, log “Fizz.”
    console.log(x);
}

// If a number is divisible by 5, log “Buzz.”
// If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, log “Fizz Buzz.”
// If a number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, log the number.
// Remember to commit your solution once it is working.
