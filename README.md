### Introduction
This assignment will have you create several different types of loops according to a specification. This will showcase the power of loops and iteration alongside JavaScript operators, comparators, and conditional statements for data creation, processing, and manipulation.
### Objectives
Use for loops to iterate a specific number of times.
Use for of loops to iterate through iterable data-like strings.
Use while loops to iterate based on a condition.
Use the break and continue statements to control loop flow.
### Submission
Submit your completed lab using the Start Assignment button on the assignment page in Canvas.
Your submission should include:
A GitHub link to your completed project repository.
### Instructions
Initialize a new git repository in a local project folder, and create a JavaScript file to contain your code. Complete the activities below. For each of the activities, decide whether it is best to use for, for of, or while loops to implement the solution.
Commit frequently! Every time something works, you should commit it. Remember, you can always go back to a previous commit if something breaks.
